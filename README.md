epEBench - Energy Benchmark
=========================

This benchmark system was designed because of the need to generate diverse, customizable workload for evaluating the energy consumption on multi-core systems. 

Full Description
-------
EpEBench is an energy benchmark capable of creating a realistic workload on a multi-core system. It can be widely parametrized in order to stress only a certain aspect of the workload on the CPU. 
Pre-defined synthetic workload models, based on instruction mix analysis, allow a realistic workload emulation of everyday applications such as QoS streaming (video player) or performance types (gzip). 
Specific load profiles can be issued to be able to analyse its impact on energy consumption and runtime.

Features
-------
It is capable of:

>- Allocating a number of worker threads to execute certain workload models and operations
>- Providing realistic workloads (**vidplay** -> multimedia app / **gzip** -> gzip app)
>- Workload models can be added and their properties modified (edit **ebmodels.ini** file)
>- Number of operations and operation types are selectable by the user
>- CPU workload can be set in percentage per thread or in total 
>- Executing load profiles with different workloads, thread counts and periods

Two implemented workloads (vidplay and gzip) replicate behavior of real applications in resprect to instruction mix characteristic.

**vidplay**: Emulates multi-threaded video-player workload (QoS streaming type)

**gzip**: Emulates single-threaded data de/compression workload (performance type)

In order to run specific operations as workload, refer to **ebmodels.ini** file.

Compilation
-------
Compile epEBench by running ``"make"``. ARMv7, x86_64, i386 and i686 machines are supported.

Benchmarking
-------
Initiate a simple testrun with ``./epebench -m vidplay -a 3 -n 4 -u 30 -t 20``

This allocates four threads *[-n]* executing the **vidplay** workload *[-m]* distributed on three cores *[-a]* with a total CPU load of 30% *[-u]* for 20 seconds *[-t]*.
The following example shows, how to starts two different models running on four threads with different usage level each (vidplay: cpu0+1 @ 30% load per thread / gzip: cpu2+3 @ 90% load per thread).

Run two workload models with ``./epebench -m vidplay gzip -n 4 -a 4 -u 30 90 -t 20``

Option *[-l {N}]* allows to loop through diverse load profiles e.g. {70%/0.1s, 10%/2s,...,80%/0.2s}. Therefor, enter time *[-t T {T1,T2,...,Tn}]* and load level values *[-u {U0,U1,...,Um}]* and enable the profile run with option *[-l {N}]*. Optionally, pass the No. of loops (default N=1).
Above example starts with ``./epebench -m vidplay -u 70 10 20 80 -t 0.1 2 1 0.2 -l 20`` and loops 20x.
A simple rectangular load profile can be initiated as follows: ``./epebench -m vidplay -u 10 80 -t 0.2 -l 30`` 

If a profile shall run for a specific number of instructions being executed, use the *[-i <INST>]* option and pass a value in Mio. Activate the profile run again with option *[-l]*.
Invoke a load profile run executing 30000 Mio instruction with e.g. ``./epebench -m vidplay -u 15 90 50 -t 3 0.2 0.1 -i 30000 -l``     

Manual
-------
usage: ``epebench [-h] [-v] [-tTIME] [-iINSTR] [-mMODEL] [-nTHREADS] [-aCPU] [-uUSAGE] [-d] [-lN] [-p] [-r]``

Options:

	-t T1 {T2...Tn}	        Time in seconds
	                        Opt: Enter a list used as test pattern [-p]
	-m MD1 {MD2...Mdn}	    Model(s) to execute (e.g. vidplay, gzip [Note-4])
	-n N {N1...Nn}	        Number of threads to allocate
		                    Opt: Enter a list used as test pattern [-p]
	-u U {U1...Un}	        CPU-load setting (0 â€“ 100)[%]
		                    Opt1: Enter a list used as test pattern[-p]
		                    Opt2: List of CPU-loads per thread (normal)
	-a CPU {CPU1...CPUn}	CPU affinity; amount or list of used cores
	-i N	                Maximum No. of instructions in Mio
	-l N					Loop mode [Note-4]. No. of load profile loops
	-d	                    CPU-usage process disable. Secondary load controller will not be working
	-p	                    Test pattern mode
	-r	                    Enable thread pinning mode
	-h	                    show this help message and exit
	-v 	                    show epEBench version
	
	
**Note-1**: List of elements in test pattern mode loops cyclically until last element of longest list is reached. Means, amount of testruns is defined by longest parameter list.  
**Note-2**: If no option is passed, benchmark starts with default values.  
**Note-3**: Thread pinning mode [-r] forces threads bound to assigned CPU but leads to a lower load level accuracy at high thread counts.  
**Note-4**: Refer to ebmodels.ini file for more information and find all available workloads.
